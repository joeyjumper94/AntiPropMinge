Anti_Prop_Minge
I created this to foil prop killers and prop spammers

to install, just extract the zip file and drop Anti_Prop_Minge-master into the server's addon folder

Workshop version http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1129686491

A series of serverside scripts i put together with the intent of preventing propkill based minges.
